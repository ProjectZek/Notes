> * Charmed and Feared characters can no longer use skills.
> * The appropriate text message is given while attempting to attack while charmed.
> * A Role Playing switched has been added so that players may identify other characters who wish to make known they are Role Playing. To activate the Role Playing switch, target your character and type "/roleplay", if the character is +PvP, the name tag above their head will appear as a darker shade of Red, whereas a non-PvP players name will appear purple.

> * A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.
> * In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a 20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon them.

> Customers on the PvP-Teams servers have been plagued by a tactic known as "Bind Rushing". Casters would bind themselves in a hostile area or dungeon, and attack everyone of an opposing race in the area. Sooner or later the caster would die. They would then respawn, memorize a few spells, then jump back in to attack their wounded opponents.

>As a first step in combating this practice and improving life for those on the PvP-Servers, casters will now respawn with zero mana after being killed by another player in a duel or open combat.

>This code is new for those on Tallon and Vallon Zek. It has been in place for some time on Rallos Zek and works very well there.

> * Being killed by another player in a duel will now cause you to re-spawn with zero mana.
