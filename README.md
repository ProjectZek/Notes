## 1999

**JUNE 7, 1999** - [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/19990607.html)

> * Charmed and Feared characters can no longer use skills.
> * The appropriate text message is given while attempting to attack while charmed.
> * A Role Playing switched has been added so that players may identify other characters who wish to make known they are Role Playing. To activate the Role Playing switch, target your character and type "/roleplay", if the character is +PvP, the name tag above their head will appear as a darker shade of Red, whereas a non-PvP players name will appear purple.

**SEPTEMBER 13, 1999** - [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/19990913.html)

> * A player under the effect of charm or fear can no longer open their spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.
> * In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage spells cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same spell would do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type spell there is a 20% chance that they will break free when a direct damage spell is cast upon them.

**SEPTEMBER 28, 1999** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/19990928.html)

> * Pet damage inflicted during PvP combat has been slightly reduced.

**DECEMBER 21, 1999** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/19991221.html)

> * In addition, it is now possible to cast Cancel Magic on non-grouped players on the PvP and PvP-teams servers.

## 2000

**FEBRUARY 3, 2000** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20000203.html)

> Customers on the PvP-Teams servers have been plagued by a tactic known as "Bind Rushing". Casters would bind themselves in a hostile area or dungeon, and attack everyone of an opposing race in the area. Sooner or later the caster would die. They would then respawn, memorize a few spells, then jump back in to attack their wounded opponents.

>As a first step in combating this practice and improving life for those on the PvP-Servers, casters will now respawn with zero mana after being killed by another player in a duel or open combat.

>This code is new for those on Tallon and Vallon Zek. It has been in place for some time on Rallos Zek and works very well there.

**FEBRUARY 23, 2000** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20000223.html)

> * Being killed by another player in a duel will now cause you to re-spawn with zero mana.

**MARCH 29, 2000** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20000329.html)

> * Area Effect "Fear" spells will no longer work in PvP. This affects a bard song, as well as the Cleric "Wave of Fear" spell.

## 2001

**FEBRUARY 21, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20010221a.html)

> * Due to the recent improvements to "Harmtouch", it is doing much more damage than it would before and unbalances PvP. As such it will now do less damage in PvP (68% of PvE, down from 80%). In addition, Shadowknights on the PvP servers were routinely killing themselves via non-XP losing means and attacking other players with Harmtouch immediately upon respawn. In order to address this situation, Harmtouch is no longer automatically "recharged" by death on the PvP Servers.

**MAY 8, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20010508.html)

> We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of EverQuest:

> Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the character will show as 'red' if he is above your range. This will only take effect on PvP servers.
Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use the Arena. This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers.

> De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.

> These are the first of the things that we plan to. We are taking a careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can, and we have other changes planned for upcoming patches.

**MAY 31, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20010531.html)

> *Resist-debuffs will do 1.5 times their normal value for PvP encounters. In other words, if the spell did -60MR in PvP before, it does -90MR in PvP now. PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains unaffected.
> * Faction-loss for PvP kills on Vallon and Tallon now only occur against factions within the hometown of the person killed. In other words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only lose faction with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.
> * Turning in the Tomb of Order and Discord will have no effect on Vallon and Tallon.
> *On all PvP servers, only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights. We would prefer to implement some sort of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP encounters.

**JUNE 27, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20010627.html)

> * If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be looted.
> * When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player that had them targeted will lose their target. This is true for all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers. The use of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.
> *Faction hits on Rallos Zek: Killing a person in one of his or her home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.

**JULY 24, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20010724.html)

> * There are no faction hits for killing half-elves in any city.
> * If an Erudite of Paineel is killed in Paineel the killer takes a faction hit (existing rule).
> * If an Erudite of Erudin is killed in Erudin the killer takes a faction hit (new rule).
> * Bards can't cast harmful spells on boats.
> * If a character kills a higher level character, the higher level character will always lose experience. This is in addition to the fact that any player killed within the + or - 5 level range will lose experience.
> * Goods and Neutrals will now be able to turn in Greater Insignias for a Magician only summon corpse potion usable only at levels over 45th.
> * Characters under level 6 will no longer be immune to PvP in many adventure zones. Players will be notified when they enter such zones.

**AUGUST 15, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20010815.html)

> * Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters.
> * Characters below 6th level cannot be pick pocketed in any zone.
> * Guards have a better chance of aggro'ing a rogue that fails at picking pockets near guards.

**AUGUST 22, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20010822.html)

> * The Resist code changes we made with the last patch should be working properly now. Here is the text about that change:
"Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters."
> * Cancel Magic spells should now work across teams.
> * Characters should no longer disappear when Mesmerized or stunned.

**NOVEMBER 7, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20011107.html)

> * Guards, when seeing PCs in combat, will now attack the one that they like the least (the one with the lowest appropriate faction). If all the PCs involved are highly regarded (have very high faction) the guards will allow them to resolve their own issues without interfering.
> * Guards should also refrain from attacking PCs that are attacked by pets of any sort.
> * Sullon Zek now has an across the board experience bonus of 20%, and the experience loss on all deaths on Sullon Zek is now 50% less.

**DECEMBER 4, 2001** [EverQuest Patch History Search](http://www.tski.co.jp/baldio/patch/20011107.html)

> * PvP looting will now display to the group.
> * Empty corpses will no longer disappear when looted by an enemy player, they will decay at the normal rate for empty corpses.
> * Guards in 'guard zones', such as cities, will continue to protect characters that they find the least offensive (the one with the highest faction). But guards in outdoor zones will be less likely to join in a fight. They will only come to the aid of people that they like. Otherwise they will not get involved in PvP combat.
